# Treatment Wetlands
##### Biochar modifies the structure of microbial communities in treatment wetland mesocosms exposed to pesticides
This repository contains the R script, the data, and the RDS files required for the analyses associated with the treatment wetlands project from our lab. In this project, we investigate the impacts of biochar and pesticides on microbial communities in mesocosms of treatment wetlands. The repository contains a zip folder called mesocosmes.zip. In this folder, you will find the R script and the csv metadata, as well as two folders, called mesocosmes_16S and mesocosmes_ITS. These folders contain all the RDS files and other files required to run the bacterial and fungal analyses, respectively. The metagenomic sequences have been deposited on NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (BioProject ID: PRJNA1270071) and can be obtained here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1270071.
