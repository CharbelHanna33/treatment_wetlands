# Treatment Wetlands
#### Biochar modifies the structure of microbial communities in treatment wetland mesocosms exposed to pesticides
This repository contains the R script, the data, and the RDS files required for the analyses associated with the treatment wetlands project from our lab. In this project, we investigate the impacts of biochar and pesticides on microbial communities in mesocosms of treatment wetlands. The metagenomic sequences have been deposited on the Sequence Read Archive and can be obtained here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/1270071.
