# Treatment Wetlands
#### Biochar modifies the structure of microbial communities in treatment wetland mesocosms exposed to pesticides
This repository contains the R script and the data required for the analyses associated with the treatment wetlands project from our lab. In this project, we investigate the impacts of biochar and pesticides on microbial communities in mesocosms of treatment wetlands. The main directory contains the R script, a csv metadata file, and two subfolders named 16S and ITS. These subfolders contain RDS objects generated with the bacterial and fungal data respectively, as well as other files required to run the analyses. The metagenomic sequences have been deposited on the Sequence Read Archive and can be obtained here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/1270071.
